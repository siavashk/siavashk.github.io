![Beautiful day in beautiful Vancouver](/assets/siavash.jpg)

I am a machine learning scientist at [Copypants](http://copypants.com) working on content-based image retrieval.

Before working at Copypants, I was briefly (seven months) a machine learning scientist at LightPath Imaging labs, a small start-up company in Vancouver, BC, Canada. At the same time, I was finishing up my PhD in electrical and computer engineering from the [University of British Columbia](http://ubc.ca) studying [image registration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration).  

Before that, I was a MSc student at [Queen's university](http://www.queensu.ca/) in Kingston, ON, Canada.

I also have an [academic](http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~siavashk) website. You can also follow me on twitter [@khallagh65](https://twitter.com/khallagh65).
