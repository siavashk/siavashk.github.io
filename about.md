I am a C++ developer at [Clarius mobile health](https://www.clarius.me/). We make portable wireless ultrasound probes that you can use with your iOS/Android devices. Before that I was a machine learning scientist at [Copypants](https://twitter.com/copypants/status/1002626136113852418) working on content-based image retrieval.

Before working at Copypants, I was finishing up my PhD in electrical and computer engineering at the [University of British Columbia](http://ubc.ca) studying [image registration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration).

Before that, I was a MSc student at [Queen's university](http://www.queensu.ca/) in Kingston, ON, Canada.

I also have an [academic](http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~siavashk) website. You can also follow me on twitter [@khallagh65](https://twitter.com/khallagh65).
