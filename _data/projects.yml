  description: PyCPD is a pure numpy implementation of the coherent point drift (CPD) algorithm. I developed it as part of my invited talk at the University of British Columbia. While preparing my <a href="http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~siavashk/teaching/UBC_October_2016/presentation1.pdf">notes</a>, I realized that most CPD implementations of CPD were bloated and not easy to install, so I developed PyCPD.
