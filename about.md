I am a machine learning scientist at [Copypants](http://copypants.com) working on
content-based image retrieval team.

Before working at Copypants, I was briefly (seven months) a machine learning scientist at LightPath Imaging labs, a small start-up company in Vancouver, BC, Canada. At the same time, I was finishing up my PhD in electrical and computer engineering from [the University of British Columbia University](http://ubc.ca) studying [image registration Nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration).  

Before that, I was a MSc student at [Queen's university](http://www.queensu.ca/) in Kingston, ON, Canada.
